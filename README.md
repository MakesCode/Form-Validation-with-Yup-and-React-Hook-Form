# Form Validation with Yup and React Hook Form

Simplify form validation in React applications with the combined power of Yup schema validation and React Hook Form. This project provides an easy-to-use solution for validating form inputs and displaying toast notifications for any validation errors.

## How It Works

1. **Validation Schema:** Define your validation schema using Yup. Customize validation rules for each form field, ensuring accurate data input.

2. **React Hook Form Integration:** Integrate the schema with React Hook Form to enable seamless form submissions and error handling.

3. **Toast Notifications:** Display toast notifications using Sonner to alert users of any validation errors in the form.
